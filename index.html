      <article><span id="SF">San Francisco,</span> the city of the uncommon, the unforeseen and the
        unexpected. People taking selfies at the Golden Gate
        bridge, skaters running hard in front of the Ferry
        building. Business meetings happenning at every corner.
        Here you'll find people from almost every corner of the Earth.
        San Francisco is home to a little bit of everything.
        Whether you’re a first time visitor or a long-time local,
        San Francisco's Golden Gates welcome all.
        This is the place to find out about all things San
        Francisco.

      <p id="cableKartPara">San Francisco holds a secure place in the United States’ romantic dream of itself—a cool, elegant,
        handsome, worldly seaport whose steep streets offer breathtaking views of one of the world’s greatest bays.
         According to the dream, San Franciscans are sophisticates whose lives hold full measures of such civilized
         pleasures as music, art, and good food.

          Rudyard Kipling once said that the only drawback to San Francisco is how hard it is to leave.
          Many San Franciscans would agree with Kipling: Bay Area natives and transplants alike tend to be
          fiercely loyal to their city, and most SFers would tell you that they could never imagine living
          anywhere else. With sweeping vistas on every hill, beautiful beaches, year-round free concerts
          and cultural activities -- not to mention some of the best food, music and art in the country --
          it's easy to see why so many have been lured by the siren song of the San Francisco Bay.

        <p>Palace of Fine Arts</p>
      </section>
        <p id="fineArtsPara">
            The Palace of Fine Arts in the Marina District of San Francisco, California, is a
            monumental structure originally constructed for the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition
            in order to exhibit works of art presented there. One of only a few surviving structures
            from the Exposition, it is still situated on its original site. It was rebuilt in 1965,
            and renovation of the lagoon, walkways, and a seismic retrofit were completed in early 2009.<br>
            In addition to hosting art exhibitions, it remains a popular attraction for
            tourists and locals and is a favorite location for weddings and wedding party photographs
            for couples throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and such an icon that a miniature replica
            of it was built in Disney's California Adventure in Anaheim.

        <p>Painted Ladies</p>
      </section>
        <p id="paintedLadiesPara">
              One of the most photographed locations in San Francisco, Alamo Square's famous
              "postcard row" at Hayes and Steiner Streets is indeed a visual treat. A tight,
              escalating formation of Victorian houses is back-dropped by downtown skyscrapers,
              providing a stunning contrast. The grassy square itself is an ideal midday break.
              One of 11 historic districts designated by the Department of City Planning, the area
              includes several bed and breakfast inns. The Painted Ladies are the best looking ladies in
              San Francisco, especially against that jaw-dropping backdrop. Learn how to get there, the
              surrounding neighborhoods and fun facts.
