      <p id="gGCard">With towers soaring 746 feet/227 meters into the sky,
        its span arcing across the mouth of San Francisco Bay,
        and all of it painted fire-engine red, the Golden Gate
        Bridge makes a dramatic destination, and a great way
        to begin a tour of the region.

      <p>Once called "the bridge that couldn't be built," today it
        is one the seven wonders of the modern world. This magnificent span, perhaps
        San Francisco's most famous landmark, opened in 1937 after a four-year struggle against
        relentless winds, fog, rock and treacherous tides.

      <p>Featured in countless photographs, films, songs and the like, the Golden Gate Bridge
        rivals the Statute of Liberty as one of the most famous symbols in American popular culture.
        Today, the bridge regularly ferries thousands of people across the strait and still shines just
        as brightly as it did when it originally opened in 1937.
