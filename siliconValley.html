          Region in San Francisco, California that is considered to be the technology
          hub of the United States. The region is made up a number of computer companies and
          computer chip manufactures. The region gets its nickname from the silicon that is used
          in computer chips. Due to the demand for space in Silicon Valley, real estate and
          other property is very expensive and hard to find.

          Silicon Valley is a nickname for the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area,
          which is located in part of the U.S. state of California known as Northern California.
          It is home to many of the world's largest high-tech corporations, as well as thousands
          of startup companies. Several companies which have enormous presence around the world
          have their headquarters in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is a term applied as a whole
          for different regions present in Northern California.

      <div id="orgList">
        <h6>Shrine for every software developer</h6>
        <p id="top">The main reason for Silicon Valley's success is its spirit of cooperation. For example, many
           founders of local companies went to school together. That makes them more likely to promote each
           other regardless of company affiliation. Personal loyalties override corporate ones. Professional networks led
           to easy information exchange. Companies found that collaboration between them made them all more successful.<br>The
           State of California prohibited non-compete clauses. As a result, star performers could leave a company to start
           their own to test out new ideas. As a result, employees focus on helping each other solve problems. An
           often-overlooked reason is Silicon Valley's cultural diversity. Between 1995-2005, more than half of its
           start-ups were founded by immigrants. Why? The Valley attracts top engineers from around the world, especially
           India and China. Diversity leads to innovation as long as everyone focuses on their shared goals.

          The most well-known Silicon Valley companies are Apple, Facebook, Google, and Netflix.
          The area also launched Tesla, Twitter, Yahoo!, and eBay. There are many business support companies such as
          Cisco, Oracle, Salesforce.com, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel. Other companies include Adobe, Intuit, and Zynga.

      <h6>What Silicon Valley is all about?</h6>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0px 5% 50px 5%;">Silicon Valley is a name that is synonymous with the technology industry, but when and how did this
         small area of California become the center of the tech world? The area's transformation happened gradually,
         over a period of more than 100 years. Here's how.<br>
         Silicon Valley is an almost $3 trillion neighborhood thanks to companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla. But
         it wasn't always this way. In the late 1800s,San Francisco's port helped make it a hub of the early telegraph and radio industries.
         In 1909, San José became home to one of the US's first radio stations.<br>

      <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0px 100px 50px 50%;">
         In 1933, the Navy purchased Moffett Field to dock and maintain the USS Macon. This made Moffett Field a major hub for the early days of the aerospace industry.
         Many scientists and researchers all found work in the area. In 1939, the Ames Research Center was founded in the area,
         and it became home to the world's largest wind tunnel in 1949.<br>
         Also in 1939, William Hewlett and Dave Packard founded Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, which originally made oscilloscopes.
         Then, during World War II, HP made radar and artillery technology. At this point, computers were about the size of a room.
         In the 1940s, William Shockley coinvented the transistor while at Bell Labs. The transistor is now known as the computer
         processor. <br>

         In 1969, the Stanford Research Institute became one of the four nodes of ARPANET. A government research project that would
         go on to become the internet. In 1970, Xerox opened its PARC lab in Palo Alto. PARC invented early computing tech, including
         ethernet computing and the graphical user interface.<br><br>
         In 1971, journalist Don Hoefler titled a 3-part report on the semiconductor industry "SILICON VALLEY USA." The name stuck.<br>
         In the 1970s, companies like Atari, Apple, and Oracle were all founded in the area In the 1980s, Silicon Valley became the widely
         accepted center of the computer industry. eBay, Yahoo, PayPal, and Google are just some of the companies founded in the area in
         the 1990s With Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and Tesla joining them the following decade. The growth of the tech industry in the area
         continues to this day.

        <h6>The Revolution</h6>
        <p>Today, Silicon Valley is home to the headquarters of multi-billion dollar IT enterprises. The beginnings were amateurish
           essays in color, chaos and revolutionary stirrings. Hippies, hobbyists and clever businessmen had set into motion an
           unbelievable revolution. The pioneers of the home computer wanted nothing less than to change the world and push “Big Brother”
           off his throne: they wanted computers for everyone.

            <p>Founded by the visionary Steve Jobs, Apple is one of several highly successful companies
              founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around
              the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company.
              By the time of the "1984" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture
              had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.
              According to a 2011 report in Fortune, this has resulted in a corporate culture
              more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.

        <p>As an innovator and visionary, Steve Jobs' accomplishments can be held on a pedestal with the likes of Microsoft’s Bill Gates,
           Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. The aforementioned names are all highly regarded within
           technology for transforming consumerism and the accessibility of information. While best known as the CEO of Apple, the late
           Jobs has had a profound effect on the world outside of technology. From purchasing Pixar in 1986 to supporting charities and
           environmental causes, Jobs’ achievements and innovations continue to affect industries and lifestyles worldwide. He changed the
           way we think about and use technology forever, putting his own stamp on everything from the personal computer to the music
           industry.
